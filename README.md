## Description

In this project, labeled tweets are examined to find associations between words in the tweets 
and hate or offensive language. The data sets are then processed and vectorized as a means to create 
machine learning models that predict whether or not a message contains hate speech or offensive 
language. The models are then used in addition to a list of profane words to create a pipeline for 
screening messages for inappropriate language. The pipeline is then tested on a labeled random sample 
from a customer service chat data set. Finally, a use case for this service is explained for the customer 
service chat domain.
